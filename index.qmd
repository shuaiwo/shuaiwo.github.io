I'm a Master's student studying City Planning and Spatial Analytics at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm passionate about leveraging the power of data science and technology for sustainable development and business growth. My current research focuses on urban technology, transportation and community development.

Prior to Penn, I worked as a Transport Planning and GIS Intern and gained my Bachelor's degree in Urban Planning at the University of Liverpool, UK.

I love travelling, and backpacked across 11 countries in Europe as my graduation trip. Seeing first hand how cultures, lifestyles, food and languages spark and interact across different places, I'm more determined to reveal the hidden dynamics that drive the development behind the development of cities, businesses and human behaviors.
